"A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with "
"\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be "
"essentially arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the :mod:`pickle` "
"module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types,"
" and objects containing lots of shared  sub-objects.  The keys are ordinary "
"strings."

"Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-"
"dictionary entry is modified.  By default modified objects are written "
"*only* when assigned to the shelf (see :ref:`shelve-example`).  If the "
"optional *writeback* parameter is set to ``True``, all entries accessed are "
"also cached in memory, and written back on :meth:`~Shelf.sync` and "
":meth:`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in "
"the persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume"
" vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close operation "
"very slow since all accessed entries are written back (there is no way to "
"determine which accessed entries are mutable, nor which ones were actually "
"mutated)."
msgstr ""
"由于 Python 语义的限制，shelf 无法确定一个可变的持久化字典条目在何时被修改。 默认情况下 *只有* 在被修改对象再赋值给 shelf "
"时才会写入该对象 (参见 :ref:`shelve-example`)。 如果可选的 *writeback* 形参设为 "
"``True``，则所有被访问的条目都将在内存中被缓存，并会在 :meth:`~Shelf.sync` 和 :meth:`~Shelf.close` "
"时被写入；这可以使得对持久化字典中可变条目的修改更方便，但是如果访问的条目很多，这会消耗大量内存作为缓存，并会使得关闭操作变得非常缓慢，因为所有被访问的条目都需要写回到字典（无法确定被访问的条目中哪个是可变的，也无法确定哪个被实际修改了）。"

"The choice of which database package will be used (such as :mod:`dbm.ndbm` "

"also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of :mod:`dbm`, if it is used"
