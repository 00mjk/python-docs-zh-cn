"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language."
"  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level "
"dynamic data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very"
" clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well"
" as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also "
"usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable "
"interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on "
"the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later."
msgstr ""
"Python 是一种解释性、交互式、面向对象的编程语言。 它包含了模块、异常、动态类型、非常高层级的动态数据类型以及类的概念。 "
"Python结合了超强的功能和极清晰的语法。 它带有许多系统调用和库以及各种窗口系统的接口，并且可以用 C 或 C ++ 来进行扩展。 "
"它还可用作需要可编程接口的应用程序的扩展语言。 最后，Python 还是可移植的：它可以在许多 Unix 变种、Mac 以及 Windows 2000 "
"以上的操作系统中运行。"
