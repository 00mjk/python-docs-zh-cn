"While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English "
"rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical "
"analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average "
"reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were "
"coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, "
"you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up "
"implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using"
" Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the "
"language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would "
"like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could "
"volunteer your time --- or invent a cloning machine :-)."

"我希望尽可能地保证内容精确无误，但还是选择使用自然词句进行描述，正式的规格定义仅用于句法和词法解析。这样应该能使文档对于普通人来说更易理解，但也可能导致一些歧义。因此，如果你是来自火星并且想凭借这份文档把"
" Python 重新实现一遍，也许有时需要自行猜测，实际上最终大概会得到一个十分不同的语言。而在另一方面，如果你正来使用 Python "
"并且想了解有关该语言特定领域的精确规则，你应该能够在这里找到它们。如果你希望查看对该语言更正式的定义，也许你可以花些时间自己写上一份 --- "
"或者发明一台克隆机器 :-)"

"It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language "
"reference document --- the implementation may change, and other "
"implementations of the same language may work differently.  On the other "
"hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread use (although "
"alternate implementations continue to gain support), and its particular "
"quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially where the "
"implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore, you'll find short "
"\"implementation notes\" sprinkled throughout the text."

"在语言参考文档里加入过多的实现细节是很危险的 --- 具体实现可能发生改变，对同一语言的其他实现可能使用不同的方式。而在另一方面，CPython "
"是得到广泛使用的 Python 实现 "
"(然而其他一些实现的拥护者也在增加)，其中的特殊细节有时也值得一提，特别是当其实现方式导致额外的限制时。因此，你会发现在正文不时会跳出来一些简短的 "
"\"实现注释\"。"

"An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports "

"The descriptions of lexical analysis and syntax use a modified BNF grammar "
"notation.  This uses the following style of definition:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/introduction.rst:100
msgid ""
"The first line says that a ``name`` is an ``lc_letter`` followed by a "
"sequence of zero or more ``lc_letter``\\ s and underscores.  An "
"``lc_letter`` in turn is any of the single characters ``'a'`` through "
"``'z'``.  (This rule is actually adhered to for the names defined in lexical"
" and grammar rules in this document.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/introduction.rst:105
msgid ""
"Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and "
"``::=``.  A vertical bar (``|``) is used to separate alternatives; it is the"
" least binding operator in this notation.  A star (``*``) means zero or more"
" repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (``+``) means one or "
"more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets (``[ ]``) means "
"zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional).  "
"The ``*`` and ``+`` operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are "
"used for grouping.  Literal strings are enclosed in quotes.  White space is "
"only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a single"
" line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each"
" line after the first beginning with a vertical bar."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/introduction.rst:119
msgid ""
"In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions are "
"used: Two literal characters separated by three dots mean a choice of any "
"single character in the given (inclusive) range of ASCII characters.  A "
"phrase between angular brackets (``<...>``) gives an informal description of"
" the symbol defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the notion of "
"'control character' if needed."

#: ../../reference/introduction.rst:126
msgid ""
"Even though the notation used is almost the same, there is a big difference "
"between the meaning of lexical and syntactic definitions: a lexical "
"definition operates on the individual characters of the input source, while "
"a syntax definition operates on the stream of tokens generated by the "
"lexical analysis. All uses of BNF in the next chapter (\"Lexical Analysis\")"
" are lexical definitions; uses in subsequent chapters are syntactic "
"definitions."
