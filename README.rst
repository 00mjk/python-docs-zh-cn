NOTE REGARDING THE LICENSE FOR TRANSLATIONS: Python's documentation is
maintained using a global network of volunteers. By posting this
project on Transifex, GitHub, and other public places, and inviting
you to participate, we are proposing an agreement that you will
provide your improvements to Python's documentation or the translation
of Python's documentation for the PSF's use under the CC0 license

return, you may publicly claim credit for the portion of the
translation you contributed and if your translation is accepted by the
PSF, you may (but are not required to) submit a patch including an
appropriate annotation in the Misc/ACKS or TRANSLATORS file. Although
